**Do not contact mod authors directly for support.**  
All support must be directed to the relevant discussion channel on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack).  
Pirated games and mods are not supported.  

Feel free to [buy me a pizza or something](https://www.patreon.com/nicholasjae).

**Modlist Summary:**  
An incredibly clean and stable list featuring tons of new quests & locations, vastly expanded settlement systems, a massively interconnected collection of NPC overhauls, and of course hundreds of new outfits, armors, & weapons. For information on how to start the new quest content, please see the bottom of the readme.

This list is NOT built with Survival Mode in mind. I don't play it. I don't like it. If you want Survival, you should play [Fallout 4 Enhanced Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition).

#### **_Requirements Before Installing:_**

  *  Current build version of [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/).  
  *  Clean install of Fallout 4, **without the official Hi Def DLC**.  Note that if you previously used BiRatBec's Workbase and replaced the texture archives in Fallout 4\data, you will need to make a backup of these and verify files to obtain the original, unmodified texture archives.
  *  A Nexusmods account. Nexus Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.  
  *  100 GB of free space. Note that this number does NOT include your Fallout 4 installation.  
    *  That’s 27.8 GB for downloads, 42.4 GB GB for installation, and a little extra wiggle room to be safe.  
  
  Once Fallout 4 is installed, *run it once through Steam.* This will establish registry keys and allow Wabbajack to locate the game on your PC. 

### **_Installation Instructions:_**

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe. Download the MagnumOpus.wabbajack file from the Wabbajack Modlist Gallery.
5. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Magnum Opus). **DO NOT** install your modlist to the same folder where you put Wabbajack.exe.  **DO NOT** install into your Steam game path.
6. The “Download Location” will update automatically. You can change it if you want.
7. Click the "Play" arrow.
8. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
9. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.current.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

#### **_Post Installation Instructions:_**

Navigate back to your Magnum Opus installation folder.  
Open “Game Folder Files”  
Copy everything in this folder.  
Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).  
  *  Just to be really clear about this: do not copy/paste the entire folder. Only the **contents** of Game Folder Files. It's only six individual little files totaling around 8 MB.

#### This section is **optional but highly recommended**. It can be done at any time before or after installation.

Go to [BiRaitBec’s Modding Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=description).  
Manually download the **WorkBase** file.  
Manually download the **Main Repack** files (Part One, Part Two, and Part Three).  
  *  You can use Performance/Quality repacks as well if you like. I only use Main. Entirely up to you.  
  
Extract the WorkBase file with 7zip.  
You should have three folders inside of Workbase: OriginalBa2, PatchedBa2, and PatchedFiles.  
Navigate to your Fallout4/Data folder and **copy** these 15 files:  

'Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2'  
'DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCRobot - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCCoast - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2'  

**Paste** these files into your **WorkBase/OriginalBa2** folder.
**Extract** Main Repack Part One into a new folder.
Inside the new folder, you should see another folder called “**textures**”. **Cut** this textures folder and **paste** it into **Workbase/PatchedFiles**.
**Repeat the previous two steps** for Part Two and Part Three of the Main Repack archives.
Run the **installer.bat** file inside of WorkBase.
When it is done, copy and paste all of the files inside of the PatchedBa2 folder into your Fallout4/Data folder AFTER WABBAJACK IS FINISHED INSTALLING.
  *  Alternatively, you can make a new folder inside Magnum Opus/mods and paste the archives into there, then activate the new mod in Mod Organizer 2. This will keep your Fallout 4 installation completely clean.  
  
After all of these steps are complete, you may delete the WorkBase folder. If you have the space, I advise making a backup of both the vanilla ba2 files as well as the patched ba2 files. It will save you the trouble of having to redownload them again later.

*Note that you CANNOT use the HD DLC for BiRaitBec’s texture optimization. You’ll see missing textures everywhere if you do.*

**Optional:** If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda:
  *  Open Steam  
  *  Right-click Fallout 4 in your Library  
  *  Click Properties  
  *  Go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to “Only update this game when I launch it.”  
*Since we’re always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again.*  

#### That’s it! Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the Magnum Opus folder. From now on, you must launch Fallout 4 via the “F4SE” option in Mod Organizer 2. 

There are two profiles here. One is just a version without Private Military Company, and I literally made it for one single person. So if you're wondering why you have patches disabled that are named "NoPMC" then...that's why. You can ignore them.  

**I do not use an ENB. Please stop asking.** If you want one, just use whatever you want. There are some comparison screenshots pinned in the Magnum-Opus-Support channel on the Wabbajack Discord server.  

Now we can launch the game. Once you finish character customization, you’ll have two options when you try to leave. Take note that this modlist uses **Start Me Up - Basic Version**. No, you can't install the Full version, you'll break a lot of stuff.  

**This is a memory, I don’t want to relive this**: You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate. Everything else is normal.  
**This is a memory, stay here a while**: Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.  

You'll get two prompts after you open the vault door in Vault 111. Just select the defaults. Once you reach the exit to Vault 111 and ride the elevator, we can finish setting up the game. Press the “Esc” key and select “Mod Config”. This is the last step, I swear.

#### For 21:9/Ultrawide Users:  
*Note that I did not write this. I don’t have ultrawide so I can’t help troubleshoot it. Another user left this here for others to possibly learn from.*

1) Install [TRUBY9](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24630). Choose XDI when asked about Patches. Select nothing else.

2) Install [TRUBY9 DEF_UI Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43275)

2) Install [TRUBY9 DEF_INV Compatibility Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43278)

3) Install [DEF_UI HUDMenuSet Ultrawidescreen](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43277)

4) Download a [standalone Adobe Flash Player from Adobe](https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/32/flashplayer_32_sa_debug.exe)

5) Paste the "flashplayer_32_sa_debug.exe" in the same location as HUDMenuSet.swf  
  *  Note that Magnum Opus already has a custom Def UI preset, aptly titled Lively's HUD Preset. Disable this mod in MO2.  
6) Execute the standalone Adobe Flash Player(the .exe you just downloaded) and load HUDMenuSet.swf (from here it will work as the DEF_UI HUDMenuSet.exe)  
7) Move the UI elements to your liking (or leave as is). Once satisfied hit Ctrl+S  
8) Create a new folder DEF_CONF in the same location as HUDMenuSet.swf and save the new XML file inside the new folder  
  *  Note that removing the brackets from the loot menu will also break Hud Plus Plus. So maybe don't do that.
9) Open up Truby9 and delete the LevelUpMenu.swf file. Failing to do this will cause an instant crash to desktop when using Baka Interface.
  *  You also need to remove the BarterMenu.swf and ContainerMenu.swf files from Truby9 and Truby9 Def UI for FallUI compatibility.

#### Crashlogs:  

Look, I'm not perfect. If your game CTDs, upload the most recent crashlog from \Documents\My Games\Fallout4\F4SE\ into the #magnum-opus-support channel on the Wabbajack Discord.

If you're consistently crashing on loading a save or exiting a specific area, it's probably an nvidia driver crash. Try reverting back to version 442.xx of your gpu driver.

#### Starting the New Content:

**Sim Settlements 2** - Pick up the magazine on top of the Sanctuary workbench. This will give you materials to build a Recruitment Beacon (Power > Misc). Build it, then wait for a minute. A stranger will approach you.  

**David Hunter** - Find him on the upper deck of the Prydwen.  

**Echo** - Note at the Diamond City Bounty Board (next to Moe Cronin's shop).  

**Xander's Aid** - Go to Dugout Inn.  

**Kelly Manor Horror** - Find a display case in the wilderness north of Parson's Creamery. Do not wear power armor inside. Do not leave your power armor immediately outside the vicinity of the manor. This is meant to be done without companions. Your screen visuals will return to normal after the quest is over, so it is recommended to do the quest in its entirety once you start it.  

**Huntress Manor** - Find Ronald either in Far Harbor or (if fog condensors are taken care of already) at a camp near the Nucleus. Only triggers after obtaining the quest to meet Longfellow.  

**Tales From the Commonwealth** - Everywhere, but a "main" quest begins in the Nahant Post Office (just to the right of the gate when you go to Nahant).
