### Banana Split

Better graphics, tons of new weapons and armor, plenty of extra content, and improved combat mechanics that provide a challenge without being overly frustrating.

#### **_Requirements Before Installing:_**

  *Current build version of Wabbajack.  
  *Clean install of Fallout 4, without HD DLC.  
  *A Nexusmods account. Nexus Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.  
  *90 gigs of free space. Note that this number does NOT include your Fallout 4 installation.  

#### **_Installation Instructions:_**

Go to [BiRaitBec's Modding Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=description) page.  
Manually download the WorkBase file.  
Manually download the Main Repack files (Part One, Part Two, and Part Three).   
Extract the WorkBase file with 7zip.  
Inside of the Workbase folder, create 2 folders called 'OriginalBa2' and 'PatchedBa2'.  
You should have three folders inside of Workbase: OriginalBa2, PatchedBa2, and PatchedFiles.  
Navigate to to your Fallout4/Data folder, Cut or Copy (Depending on how much space you have) these 15 files:  

'Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2'  
'Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2'  
'DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCRobot - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCCoast - Textures.ba2'  
'DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2'  

Paste these files into your WorkBase/OriginalBa2 folder.  
Extract all three Main Repack files.  
Move the "Textures" folders from these extracted archives into the "PatchedFiles" folder.  
Run the installer.bat file inside of WorkBase.  
When it is done, cut and paste all of the files inside of the PatchedBa2 folder into your Fallout4/Data folder.  
After pasting those files, you may Delete the WorkBase folder.  

*Note that you CANNOT use the HD DLC for BiRaitBec’s texture optimization. You’ll see missing textures everywhere if you do.*  

As for the extra steps involved, it’s for the best. First, it enables users to easily swap between Banana Split and Fallout 4 Enhanced Edition. Second, it’s just better for your overall gaming experience.  
*If you ever need to update your Fallout 4, back up these new ba2 files before you verify/update. Otherwise you’ll have to do it all over again.*  
Anyway, now that we got that over with, let’s move on.

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack (v2.0.5.0 at the time of this writing).
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe. Download the newest BananaSplit v3.0.5.wabbajack file from the Wabbajack Modlist Gallery.
9. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Banana Split). **DO NOT** install your modlist to the same folder where you put Wabbajack.exe.
10. The “Download Location” will update automatically. You can change it if you want.
11. Click the "Play" arrow.
12. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
13. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.current.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

#### **_Post Installation Instructions:_**

Navigate back to your Banana Split installation folder.  
Open “Game Folder Files”  
Copy everything in this folder.  
Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).  

That’s it! Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the Banana Split folder. From now on, launch Fallout 4 via the “F4SE” option.  
If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda, open Steam, right-click Fallout 4 in your Library, open Properties, go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to “Only update this game when I launch it.” Since we’re always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again.  

Now, we still have a little bit of work left to do, but we’re almost done. Now we can launch the game. Once you finish character customization, you’ll have three options when you try to leave. Take note that this modlist uses **Start Me Up - Basic Version**.  

**This is a dream**: You will wake up in Vault 111. Nora is not your wife. Codsworth is not your robot. You’re just a random Prewar Sanctuary citizen.  
**This is a memory, I don’t want to relive this**: You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate. Everything else is normal.  
**This is a memory, stay here a while**: Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.  

Once you reach the exit to Vault 111 and ride the elevator, we can finish setting up the game. Press the “Esc” key and select “Mod Config”. This is the last step, I swear.
