### Banana Split ![build-status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?label=%20&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuild.wabbajack.org%2Flists%2Fstatus%2Fbanana_split%2Fbadge.json)

Better graphics, tons of new weapons and armor, plenty of extra content, and improved combat mechanics that provide a challenge without being overly frustrating.

#### **_Requirements Before Installing:_**

  *Current build version of Wabbajack.  
  *Clean install of Fallout 4, without HD DLC.  
  *A Nexusmods account. Nexus Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.  
  *115 gigs of free space. Note that this number does NOT include your Fallout 4 installation.  

#### **_Installation Instructions:_**

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe. Download the BananaSplit.wabbajack file from the Wabbajack Modlist Gallery.
5. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Banana Split). **DO NOT** install your modlist to the same folder where you put Wabbajack.exe.  **DO NOT** install into your Steam game path.
6. The “Download Location” will update automatically. You can change it if you want.
7. Click the "Play" arrow.
8. Sacrifice your firstborn to Halgari.
9. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
10. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.current.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

#### **_Post Installation Instructions:_**

Navigate back to your Banana Split installation folder.  
Open “Game Folder Files”  
Copy everything in this folder.  
Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).  

That’s it! Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the Banana Split folder. From now on, launch Fallout 4 via the “F4SE” option.  
If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda, open Steam, right-click Fallout 4 in your Library, open Properties, go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to “Only update this game when I launch it.” Since we’re always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again.  

Now, we still have a little bit of work left to do, but we’re almost done. Now we can launch the game. Once you finish character customization, you’ll have three options when you try to leave. Take note that this modlist uses **Start Me Up - Basic Version**.  

**This is a dream**: You will wake up in Vault 111. Nora is not your wife. Codsworth is not your robot. You’re just a random Prewar Sanctuary citizen.  
**This is a memory, I don’t want to relive this**: You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate. Everything else is normal.  
**This is a memory, stay here a while**: Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.  

Once you reach the exit to Vault 111 and ride the elevator, we can finish setting up the game. Press the “Esc” key and select “Mod Config”. This is the last step, I swear.  

#### MCM Settings:
