## What is Keizaal?

A few criteria for the mods on this list:

1. **The modlist is lite and intends to maintain the Vanilla feel.** A lot of the time modlists can become ridiculously huge and bloated, but this modlist wants to be nice and lean. Less is more.
2. **Immersion is paramount.** I'm a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod as a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.  
3. **Mods must have decent longevity.** This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.  
4. **Stability is the most important thing.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.

## Essentials

There are some mods that every installation of Skyrim just needs to have. This includes a ton of fixes from SKSE to Meh321's various engine-level fixes. I won't spend time talking much about this because I'm sure you're all aware of this and know what to expect. However, I will highlight some of the inclusions unique to Keizaal.

UI is very important because it effects all players. **SkyUI** and **RaceMenu** is a natural inclusion in virtually every installation of Skyrim on PC; however, some lesser-known UI extensions have been included in Keizaal. First and foremost is **moreHUD**, a great mod that gives the player more information outside of menus. This mostly comes in the form of tooltips before you pick up objects or the display of enemy level and soul size, this mod just gives players access to more information on the fly without needing to dig into more menus. **Extended UI** helps more easily digest the rather clunky skills menu, it places all the stats nicely on the bottom of the screen so it's easy to see you skill levels all at once. Lastly **Main Menu Design Replacer** just gives a different feel to the main menu we've been using all these years.

I like to cater to a lot of different people who want to play the game in different ways. One example of this is prespective. I don't think it's wrong to say that most people prefer to play in first-person, but I know there are many, including my wife, who actually like third person better. As such I've included a package of mods aimed to make the third-person experience feel more digestible. **SmoothCam** is the the heavy-hitter in this category, it completely changes how the third-person camera behaves. It is much more fluid and natural, making Skyrim feel so much better when playing in third-person. Additionally I have **Alternative Conversation Camera** packed into Keizaal as an optional mod to tick. It changes how dialouge is handled by locked onto the speaker and zooming in slightly. This works really well in third-person because it forces both the player and the NPC to actually look at eachother during the conversation, something that didn't really happen in Vanilla.

Lastly I have a short list of miscellaneous mods I wanted to talk about in this section. **BlockSteal** prevents the player from stealing any object unless they are actively sneaking, this is a very nice how to prevent you from accidently stealing some bread in front of the bartender and immediately getting arrested. **GIST - Genuinely Intelligent Soul Trap** improves the logic that the game uses when deciding which soul gem to place the soul you captured in, no longer will you have a bunch of Grand Soul Gems with Skeever souls.
