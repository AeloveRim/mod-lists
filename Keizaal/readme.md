## What is Keizaal?

A few criteria for the mods on this list:

1. **The modlist is lite and intends to maintain the Vanilla feel.** A lot of the time modlists can become ridiculously huge and bloated, but this modlist wants to be nice and lean. Less is more.
2. **Immersion is paramount.** I'm a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod as a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.  
3. **Mods must have decent longevity.** This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.  
4. **Stability is the most important thing.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.

## Essentials

There are some mods that every installation of Skyrim just needs to have. This includes a ton of fixes from USSEP to Meh321's various engine-level fixes. I won't spend time talking much about this because I'm sure you're all aware of this and know what to expect. However, I will highlight some of the inclusions unique to Keizaal.

UI is very important because it effects all players. SkyUI is a natural inclusion in virtually every installation of Skyrim on PC.
