# What is Keizaal?

A few criteria for the mods on this list:

1. **The modlist is lite and intends to maintain the Vanilla feel.** A lot of the time modlists can become ridiculously huge and bloated, but this modlist wants to be nice and lean. Less is more.
2. **Immersion is paramount.** I'm a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod has a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.  
3. **Mods must have decent longevity.** This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.  
4. **Stability is the most important thing.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.

You can find a full list of the mods included in Keizaal [here](https://modwat.ch/u/Keizaal/). If you feel like this modlist is for you, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DnVSjHktriJga9eRmonNzls3hIO0OocoIqYSg_qLqMo/edit?usp=sharing) to go to the readme and begin installation.

If you're still curious about what Keizaal has in store for you, I have provided a brief overview below.

## Essentials

![Keizaal 2.5.0](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wWh9sdQ3tEqnCP4ulTiaT1ClifCJMdJe)

There are some mods that every installation of Skyrim just needs to have. This includes a ton of fixes from [SKSE64](https://skse.silverlock.org/) to [meh321](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2964753?tab=user+files)'s various engine-level fixes. I won't spend time talking much about this because I'm sure you're all aware of this and know what to expect. However, I will highlight some of the inclusions unique to Keizaal.

UI is very important because it effects all players. [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) and [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) is a natural inclusion in virtually every installation of Skyrim on PC; however, some lesser-known UI extensions have been included in Keizaal. First and foremost is [moreHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12688), a great mod that gives the player more information outside of menus. This mostly comes in the form of tooltips before you pick up objects or the display of enemy level and soul size, this mod just gives players access to more information on the fly without needing to dig into more menus. [Extended UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57873/) helps more easily digest the rather clunky skills menu, it places all the stats nicely on the bottom of the screen so it's easy to see you skill levels all at once. Lastly [Main Menu Design Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30810) just gives a different feel to the main menu we've been using all these years.

I like to cater to a lot of different people who want to play the game in different ways. One example of this is prespective. I don't think it's wrong to say that most people prefer to play in first-person, but I know there are many, including my wife, who actually like third person better. As such I've included a package of mods aimed to make the third-person experience feel more digestible. [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252) is the the heavy-hitter in this category, it completely changes how the third-person camera behaves. It is much more fluid and natural, making Skyrim feel so much better when playing in third-person. Additionally I have [Alternate Conversation Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21220) packed into Keizaal as an optional mod to tick. It changes how dialouge is handled by locked onto the speaker and zooming in slightly. This works really well in third-person because it forces both the player and the NPC to actually look at eachother during the conversation, something that didn't really happen in Vanilla.

Lastly I have a short list of miscellaneous mods I wanted to talk about in this section. [BlockSteal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18732) prevents the player from stealing any object unless they are actively sneaking, this is a very nice how to prevent you from accidently stealing some bread in front of the bartender and immediately getting arrested. [GIST - Genuinely Intelligent Soul Trap](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15755) improves the logic that the game uses when deciding which soul gem to place the soul you captured in, no longer will you have a bunch of Grand Soul Gems with Skeever souls. [To Your Face](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24720) adjusts NPC behavior so they won't blurt out random comments while you pass them in the street unless you're directly facing them.

## Graphics

![Keizaal 2.1.0](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GXFgojMYeZdrdaDVwKyqr7mbhIMFnQUQ)

Keizaal contains a large visual package to improve the visual fidelity of the game while sticking true to the original art style that Bethesda presented us. I use a mixture of [Project Clarity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Project+Clarity,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false), [aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382), [Skyrim Realistic Overhaul](https://www.moddb.com/mods/skyrim-realistic-overhaul), [Osmodius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1782) and [Noble Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21423) as a base to build off of. From there I add on a wide array of texture and mesh replacer that are too numerous to list here individually. I will discuss some of the more noteworth inclusions.

The [Static Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659) serves as the base of my mesh replacers. It reworks a ton of Vanilla models to make them more three-dimensonal and believable. The [High Poly Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12029) covers a lot of other items that SMIM misses with a large selection of new models and textures. In addition to these mods there are several individual mesh replacers that help to complete the package, this includes but is not limited to mods such as [Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312), [3D Pine Grass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42032), and [3D Snowberries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42033).

While the character models in Skyrim have aged much better than those in Oblivion, there is still room for improvement! I used [Tempered Skins for Males and Females](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?RH_ModList=nav%3Atrue%2Chome%3Afalse%2Ctype%3A0%2Cuser_id%3A0%2Cgame_id%3A1704%2Cadvfilt%3Atrue%2Csearch%5Bfilename%5D%3ATempered+Skins%2Csearch%5Bauthor%5D%3Atraa108%2Cinclude_adult%3Atrue%2Cpage_size%3A20%2Cshow_game_filter%3Afalse%2Copen%3Atrue&BH=2&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Tempered+Skins+for,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,tags_no%5B%5D:1081&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Tempered,search%5Bauthor%5D:traa108,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true) for the humanoid races and [Masculine and Femanine Khajiit and Argonians](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?BH=3&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Texture,search%5Bauthor%5D:MONSTERaider,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,Feminine:) for the beast races. Note that I chose to forgoe the nuditiy options because I want Keizaal to be a strictly safe for work list. I used a mixture of [Bed Head](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8528) and [High Poly Vanilla Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41863) to try and improve Skyrim's glue-like hair, it is still not perfect but it is better than nothing. I have chosen to not use any hair replacers because they all either look super out-of-place in Skyrim or they lack the proper armor addons to make them work correctly with helmets and the like. However, [Hvergelmir's Aesthetics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?BH=2&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,search%5Bauthor%5D:Hvergelmir,search%5BOLD_mname%5D:lthot) and **Beast Hair Horn and Beard** do add a few new character creation options such brows and beards. Keizaal also includes [Weathered Nordic Bodypaints](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19594) and [Beast Race Bodypaints](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20446) for anyone that is into that. Lastly let's not forget the children! [Simple Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22789) is my sole child mod that covers everything quite nicely.

Good lighting is the key to sell anything graphical. You can have the prettiest textures and the most well crafted models there is, but they will suffer severely if you do not provide good lighting for them to be displayed in. That being said I did not want to go overbroad on the lighting and make an exceptionally dark game. The backbone of my lighting in the [Truth ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9162). It adds a lot of new visual effects to the game to make it look more modern, but stays within the realm of Vanilla. On top of that I have a combination of [Luminosity Lighting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16830) and [ENB Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22574) to improve the visual fiedelity of lighting. I could be amiss to not mention [Obsidian Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125); while it is not strictly a lighting mod it effects the weathers and they have a big impact on how light looks in exterior locations.

Besides for the mods listed above Gamwich's [Rustic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?BH=0&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Rustic,search%5Bauthor%5D:Gamwich,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true) series covers a large swath of texture replacers alongside other authors such as [ElSopa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6960827?tab=user+files) and [Rally](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/39335975?tab=user+files). Nearly all of my water is handled by the wonderful [Water for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061) by mindflux.

## Animations

![Keizaal 2.3.6](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DZh-2zEXyO35mo7-0Q0WlUOrexqkRX3j)

This modlist does not contain any distinctly new or overly flashy animations. As with the rest of these mods I try to stick close to the Vanilla style, but enhance things when possible. The [Movement Behavior Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38950) is a great example of a mod like this, it adds a few great things to movement animations to make them feel more natural. First and foremost it introduces procedural leaning, this simply means that characters will lean slightly in the direction they are moving to give a better sense of weight. The mod also adds a ton of new transition animations beteween movement directions to make everything flow better as opposed to Vanilla's immediate turning. [Immersive Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4254) is a nice companion piece to this mod as it makes slight tweaks to animations to remove some jank (notably the dual-wield idle stance).

The [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746) is a rather revolutionary new resource available for modders to use as a framework. The purpose of this framework is to give modders to ability to add new animations to the game that trigger under certain conditions without needing to rely on tools such as [Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main). This allows mods such as [Dynamic Swiming](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34853), [EVG Animation Variance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38534), and [EVG Conditional Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006) to exist. Each of these mods swap out or trigger new animations depending on a state. For example with EVG Conditional Idles your player may play a winded animation when at low stamina or an injured animations when at low health. All of these mods add little touches to Skyrim that really help you get immersed into the world. I am a big fan.

## Gameplay

![Keizaal 3.1.1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1vDGiSmWTsryhJiczZqHwrhRgkapAuMsz)

Next up we will be discussing perhaps the most important part of a modlist, the gameplay! Keizaal is largely built around [Simon Magus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files)' overhaul mods (affectionately referred to as "SimonRim"), they are a great series of mods that lines up perfectly with what I'm trying to accomplish with this list. Simon doesn't attempt to change Skyrim completely, but rather to take what it gives us and enhance it to be the best version that it can be. [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) is the backbone for this entire experience. It is a perk overhaul that attempts to make every tree worthwhile and introduce new and fun playstyles to build around, all without becoming too bloated or straying too far away from what Skyrim is. [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) is a combat overhaul that tries to make Skyrim combat more active and engaging without turning it into a Dark Souls clone. Both Simon and I have a pet peeve for combat mods that try to emulate Souls-likes, not because we don't enjoy those games, but rather because we don't think it fits Skyrim's gameplay very well. Blade and Blunt puts a particular emphasis on power attacks and adaqute resource management of your health, magicka, and stamina. I would be amiss not to mention perhaps Simon's most famous mod: [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839). This mod aims to overhaul magic in Skyrim and fill gaps in Vanilla progression. A lot of new spells have been seamlessly integrated into leveled lists and many more spells have been re-balanced to better fit into the progression that Simon has established. Each of these overhaul mods are a great addition to Keizaal and serve to improve on areas of Skyrim without changing it to be completely unrecognizable.
