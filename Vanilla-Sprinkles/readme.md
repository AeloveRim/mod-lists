**Vanilla Sprinkles Readme**

**What I want from this list**


When I first started playing Fallout 4 many years ago, I realized that there were many issues with this game, both with low quality textures, and that there were some quality of life things that I felt were missing. With the creation of the Wabbajack installer, I decided to create a list of mods I thought would solve most of these issues, so others could use it as a base to build their own mod lists off of!



**What Vanilla Sprinkles IS: 
Major texture upgrades as well as quality of life improvements and bug fixes

**What Vanilla Sprinkles ISN'T:
Major game play overhauls or changes that affect storyline


Because of this, there will be no armor or weapon mods added to the list.


**Requirements:
All Fallout 4 DLCs (Excluding the HD DLC) - This can not be avoided
A Clean Fallout 4 Installation - This means no mods in your game folder AT ALL.
About 50 GB of free space to download and install the mods
Premium Nexus subscription. Wabbajack uses the Nexus API, which requires a premium account in order to utilize.
