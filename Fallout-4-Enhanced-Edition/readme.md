## What this modlist is:

This is a modlist, without the effort of the many modders who make the 200+ mods of this modlist, this list is nothing. I would like to highlight some of the most important mods that you will notice throughout your time with this Modlist.

* [Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17374) by [Zawinul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/6015119) (This mod is the backbone of the list, if a system is different from vanilla, it's likely Zaw's work)
* [HD Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40159) by [SavrenX](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/55611457) (A Majority of the game textures have been overhauled by these textures, kindly re-packaged by [BiRaitBec](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/43913757?tab=about+me))
* [Tales from the Commonwealth](http://3dnpc.com/) by [Kris Takahashi](http://3dnpc.com/author/kristakahashigmail-com/) (New quests and places to explore!)
* [Beantown Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4612) by [Chucksteel](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/981385) (If a building was closed, now it is open, thanks to Chucksteel!)
* [Comprehensive Power Armor Merge](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31657) by [Yvileapsis](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/53378266), maintained by [Greb751](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/30396610) (This is a complete merge of Power Armor mods by various authors, all patched to fit Horizon!)
* [Boston Natural Surroundings](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30673) by [Silverfox600](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/4911415) (This mod adds all of the amazing extra trees, adding to the ambiance of the game!)
* [VAFS Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36519) by [Itzal713](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/5977999) (This adds the awesome bullet time, which I can't live without!)

Your game will be much less recognizable and very tough, especially at early levels; you have been warned. Along with being more difficult, this modlist makes Fallout 4 look better, play better, adds new guns, new ways to build settlements, new strategies and ways to roleplay your character. It even adds new content to explore all over the map. New NPCs, new quests, new adventures, and new enemies to fight, all fitting into the world and making it that much more enjoyable. Fallout 4 always seemed a little empty, so now you have more things to play around with to fill the world yourself, as well as new things that already fill some of the empty void! Roleplay to your heart's content, or find a way to become the strongest being in the Commonwealth; it's all up to you! Oh, and the annoying voice of the main character is gone, so you can sound like yourself for once! You are not shoehorned into being whoever the game tells you to. You are you. Play this game how YOU want to, not like how Bethesda wants you to.

### The main differences in 2.0:

* Precombines are complete, and performance is vastly improved!
* Extreme Quality textures are now an option to be used
* New Quest mods were added!
* Everything has been polished and looked over so the world feels like it was always meant to be this way
* See patchnotes [here](https://github.com/AUGSpeed/HRE-Repository/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more details

## Requirements:

* All Fallout 4 DLCs (Except for the HD DLC) - No, this is not negotiable
* A CLEAN Fallout 4 Installation - meaning without any previous mods in any way.
* About 130 GB of free disk space on top of your Fallout installation, so about 130 GBs total (this will go down after installation is finished, but this much is required during the install process).
