## What this modlist does:

Your game will be much less recognizable and very tough, especially at early levels; you have been warned. Along with being more difficult, this modlist makes Fallout 4 look better, play better, adds new guns, new ways to build settlements, new strategies and ways to roleplay your character. It even adds new content to explore all over the map. New NPCs, new quests, new adventures, and new enemies to fight, all fitting into the world and making it that much more enjoyable. Fallout 4 always seemed a little empty, so now you have more things to play around with to fill the world yourself, as well as new things that already fill some of the empty void! Roleplay to your heart's content, or find a way to become the strongest being in the Commonwealth; it's all up to you! Oh, and the annoying voice of the main character is gone, so you can sound like yourself for once! You are not shoehorned into being whoever the game tells you to. You are you. Play this game how YOU want to, not like how Bethesda wants you to.

### THIS MODLIST USES HORIZON AS THE MAIN MOD TO OVERHAUL GAMEPLAY!

### This modlist will:

* Make the game harder.
* Create an environment more conducive to roleplaying.
* Add more content to the game.
* Make veterans of the game go: "Wait, this is still Fallout 4?"
* Make your game look great with minimal performance impact.
* Add more guns and equipment to the game world.

### This modlist will NOT:

* Get you a girlfriend/boyfriend.
* Cure cancer.

## Requirements:

* All Fallout 4 DLCs (Except for the HD DLC) - No, this is not negotiable
* A CLEAN Fallout 4 Installation - meaning without any previous mods in any way.
* About 100 GB of free disk space on top of your Fallout installation, so about 130 GBs total (this will go down after installation is finished, but this much is required during the install process).

## Installing with Wabbajack:

### Step 0:

Create a new folder named 'F4EE' anywhere outside of Program Files. Then, download Wabbajack and select Fallout 4 Enhanced Edition from the list of modlists shown, and install it.

### Step 1:

After it finishes, go to your install folder, and open up the `Game Folder Files` and Copy these all into your Fallout 4 Directory.

### Step 2:

Download the latest ENB binaries from [the ENB website](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm). Open the archive you downloaded, and go into the `WrapperVersion` folder. Extract ONLY the two files `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` into your Fallout 4 Directory.

### Step 3:

Go back to your install folder. In a folder named `WorkBase`, create a folder called `OriginalBa2`.

### Step 4:

Then, go to your `Fallout4/Data` folder, Cut or Copy (Depending on how much space you have) these 15 files:  

* `Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2`
* `Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2`
* `DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2`
* `DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2`
* `DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2`
* `DLCRobot - Textures.ba2`
* `DLCCoast - Textures.ba2`
* `DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2`

Paste these files into your `install folder/WorkBase/OriginalBa2` folder.

### Step 5:

Run the installer.bat file inside of WorkBase, and when it is done (grab a coffee, you're gonna be here for a little), Cut and Paste all of the files inside of the `PatchedBa2` folder into your `Fallout4/Data` folder, and overwrite if necessary. After pasting those files, you may Delete the `WorkBase` folder.

### Step 6:

Launch MO2 from the exe found in your install folder. When it launches, be sure to select `Portable` and then `Fallout 4`. You can take the optional tutorial if you would like. Once launched, in your right pane, select the `Downloads` tab.

### Step 7:

In the top right of MO2, select use the drop down menu to select `FO4Config`, and hit the `Run` button to the right of that. When opened, direct it to your `Fallout4.exe` location. After this is done, follow these pictures and instructions --->  [Click Here](https://imgur.com/a/0On3H1o). Just make sure to copy those images, and you will be good. After that is done, be sure to click `Save` and close the program.

### Step 8:

Follow any Optional Additional Mods steps on the [Nexus F4EE page](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39996) that you feel like using. These mods are officially okay to add on top of F4EE. Launch the game using F4SE (located in the top right of MO2).

### Step 9:

After creating your character, you should configure the MCM menus found at the top of your pause menu. Follow [these pictures](https://imgur.com/a/sTVhaFd) and you will be good! After getting the Pipboy, make sure to load both the True Storms Config and Beantown Interiors holotapes, then follow the final images in the link above to finish your config!
