## What this modlist does:

Your game will be much less recognizable and very tough, especially at early levels; you have been warned. Along with being more difficult, this modlist makes Fallout 4 look better, play better, adds new guns, new ways to build settlements, new strategies and ways to roleplay your character. It even adds new content to explore all over the map. New NPCs, new quests, new adventures, and new enemies to fight, all fitting into the world and making it that much more enjoyable. Fallout 4 always seemed a little empty, so now you have more things to play around with to fill the world yourself, as well as new things that already fill some of the empty void! Roleplay to your heart's content, or find a way to become the strongest being in the Commonwealth; it's all up to you! Oh, and the annoying voice of the main character is gone, so you can sound like yourself for once! You are not shoehorned into being whoever the game tells you to. You are you. Play this game how YOU want to, not like how Bethesda wants you to.

### The main differences in 1.2:

* 5 NEW Quest mods!
* Overhauled crafting for Weapons, Clothing and Armor!
* Better AI for enemies as well as Companions
* Better Stability, and less save corruption
* Greater than 60 FPS capability! (If your system can run it)
* New armor for Raiders, Gunners, Minutemen and BOS! (All distributed in the levelled lists too!)
* 3 new Guns!

## Requirements:

* All Fallout 4 DLCs (Except for the HD DLC) - No, this is not negotiable
* A CLEAN Fallout 4 Installation - meaning without any previous mods in any way.
* About 100 GB of free disk space on top of your Fallout installation, so about 130 GBs total (this will go down after installation is finished, but this much is required during the install process).

## Installing with Wabbajack:

### Step 0:

Run Fallout 4 once from Steam. You can close the launcher when it detects your video settings. After this, create a new folder named 'F4EE' anywhere outside of Program Files. Then, download [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and select Install From Disk and select the F4EE file you just downloaded, and install it to the folder you just made.

### Step 1:

After it finishes, go to your install folder, and open up the `Game Folder Files` folder and Copy these all into your Fallout 4 Directory.

### Step 2:

Download the latest ENB binaries from [the ENB website](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm). Open the archive you downloaded, and go into the `WrapperVersion` folder. Extract ONLY the two files `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` into your Fallout 4 Directory.

### Step 3:

Launch MO2 from the exe found in your install folder.

### Step 4:

In the top right of MO2, use the drop down menu to select `FO4Config`, and hit the `Run` button to the right of that. When opened, direct it to your `Fallout4.exe` location. DO NOT replace the Fallout4Launcher if prompted. After this is done, follow these instructions for each of the tabs:

* **Tweaks**:   
Activate `Always Active`, `Invalidate Archives` and `Fix Sensitivity Ratio`.
* **Performance**:  
Next to `iNumHWThreads`, put the number of cores that your CPU has. Next to `Dir Distance`, put 3000. Disable `Radial Blur`. For performance over beauty, put the field next to `Resolution` to 2048 or lower.
* **Camera**:  
Feel free to edit your field of view as much as you like here.
* **Textures/Decals**:  
Click the `Recommended` button, and set `Max Actor Decals` to 40.
* **UI**:  
Simply change the colors to your liking.
* **Gameplay**:  
Set `Difficulty` to 5, enable `Dialogue Subtitles`, and feel free to disable `Show Tutorials` if you already know everything.
* **Final Step**:  
Now, hit 'Save' in the bottom left.

For a final (Optional) Tweak to make your Flashlight plain white, click on the small file folder button to the left of the 'Active' Counter above the left pane. Select 'Open INIs Folder', and open your Fallout4Custom.ini file. Add:

`[Pipboy]`

`bPipboyEffectColorOnLight=0`

### Step 5:

Now, launch your game from F4SE in your MO2! After creating your character, you should configure the MCM menus found at the top of your pause menu. Follow these steps and you will be good!

* **Better Locational Damage**:   
Mod Settings: Set `Helmet Protection` and `Bandage Heal` to `OFF`.
* **HoloTime**:   
For `Toggle HoloTime Display`, set it to the `?/` key. Then, click on `Widget Position`, and move the widget to the very top middle of your screen, with `Y` being close to 1, and `X` being close to half of your monitor's resolution width. Then, ensure that scale is `0.5`.
* **VAFS Redux**:  
Focus: For `Hotkey: Toggle Focus`, put `Q`. If you cannot, rebind VATS in your regular settings menu.
Attack: For `Hotkey Use Critical`, put `L Alt`.
* **Workshop Framework**:  
Options: Set `Auto Assign Beds`, `Auto Assign Defenses`, and `Auto Assign Food` to `OFF`.
* **Workshop Plus**: 
Options: Set `Invulnerability in Workshop Mode`, `Invisibility in Workshop Mode`, `Clear the weather in Workshop Mode`, and `Unlimited Carry Weight in Workshop Mode` to `OFF`.
* **Beat The Vault**:  
After setting these options, go to the door of the bathroom and click the only applicable button, `This is only a dream. I need to wake up`. And then after that, `The bombs were falling, and I had just entered a pod in a vault`. This start is the ONLY OFFICIAL, SUPPORTED START. Others may be buggy, and crash your game. But, you will still be able to roleplay as someone who came from the vault in this start, but not the Father of Shaun. You will simply be someone who witnessed the murder of a person and saw their son stolen. Now, play through the vault until you get outside.
* **Immerive HUD**:  
Now, before you configure this menu, MAKE SURE that your HoloTime widget as well as your compass are visible. If they are, then great, you can start configuring! If not, ensure that you use that hotkey you set earlier to enable HoloTime.   
After that, Set `Immersive HUD Enabled` to `ON`. Then, set `Settings Holotape` and `AID Toggle Items` to `OFF`. Set your `Hotkey to Toggle HUD` to `X`.   
Under `Crosshair`, set `Weapon` and `Hit Marker` to `Always`.   
In `Health`, set `Health below (%)` to `0.5`. Under `AP`, set `AP below (%)` to `0.5`.   
Under `Other Settings`, set `Active Effects` to `Always`.
* **Beantown Interiors**:  
Now, open your PipBoy, go to `Misc`, and `Settings`, and open the `Beantown Interiors` Holotape. Go to `Customize Options -> Other Options` and `Enable Hardcore Clutter`. Then, go to `Mod Compatibility` and `Enable Insidejobs Compatibility`.
* **True Storms Configuration**:  
Now, open the Holotape `True Storms Configuration` and enable `True Storms Effects`. If you want the game to be extra hard, keep `Constant Rads (Rad Rain)` Enabled, and also Enable `Ghoul Horde Chance`.
