### 1.1 What Is The Phoenix Flavour?

First published in 2017, [The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com/) is a veteran among Skyrim SE guides. Over the past years, it has slowly evolved into a full-grown guide and made a name for itself as being easy to follow and thorough all around. It transitioned from a modular guide with too many ideas into a more streamlined approach. Thanks to the contributions of some incredibly talented and helpful people, we now feature more than 500 mods that work flawlessly together!

Please join [The Phoenix Flavour Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SV5N6n7/) server for information in regards to the guide itself, or to simply show some appreciation to the TPF team.

### 1.2 Requirements Before Installing

-   Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack).

-   Clean install of Skyrim Special Edition - note that your game should be installed OUTSIDE of any Windows-protected folder such as Program Files.

-   101 gigs of free space. Note that this number does NOT include your Skyrim SE installation.

-   You will also need a few extra gigs if Wabbajack is running on the same drive as your installation location, as the program needs space for VFS Staging (the folder in which Wabbajack runs its processes to complete its job).

A Nexus Premium account is highly recommended for automatic download support.

Pirated games and mods are NOT supported.

Once Skyrim is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the Skyrim splash screen and exit).

### 1.3 Installation Instructions

-   Download the latest version of Wabbajack (1.0 beta 22.1 at the time of this writing).

-   Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).

-   Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.

If you are manually downloading and installing the modlist using the "Install from Disk" option:

-   Download the newest The Phoenix Flavour.wabbajack file from the Wabbajack Discord linked above.

-   Place the modlist file into a new folder (example: D:\Wabbajack\downloaded_mod_lists)

-   Launch Wabbajack.exe

-   Select "Install from Disk"

-   Choose the The Phoenix Flavour.wabbajack file you just downloaded.

For automatic installations:

-   Launch Wabbajack.exe and choose the "Browse Modlists" option.

-   Select "The Phoenix Flavour" from the list of available modlists on the Wabbajack UI.

-   Click "Download and Install."

For both manual and automatic installations:

-   In "Installation Location" choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Phoenix Flavour).

-   This location CANNOT be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.

-   This location CANNOT be where you have the The Phoenix Flavour.wabbajack file saved.

-   This location CANNOT be inside of a Windows-protected folder, such as Program Files.

-   The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.

-   Click the "Play" arrow.

-   Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.

-   When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

### 1.4 Post-Installation Instructions

-   Navigate back to your Phoenix Flavour installation folder.

-   Open "Game Folder Files"

-   Copy everything in this folder.

-   Paste it into your Skyrim SE directory (steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition).

### 1.5 ENB Settings

ENBs are never mandatory, but are highly recommended. The Phoenix Flavour recommends using Visceral ENB.

Also important to note: many of the mods installed here rely on an ENB. If you choose not to install an ENB, you will have some strange looking textures, such as flat blue snow that seems to hover on top of the ground, for example.

For instructions on how to set up and use this - or any other - ENB Preset, just click the link below:

[ENBSeries section on The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com/guide/finalisation/step-2/)

If you follow the steps exactly as written, you'll have a perfectly installed ENB, along with an ENB Manager and the knowledge of how to use it properly. And it only takes five to ten minutes! Easy.

Last thing to note in regards to ENBs: The Phoenix Flavour uses [Obsidian Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125), so make sure your ENB of choice supports this weather mod.

Well, that does it. Time to start a new game!

### 1.6 First Launch

Congratulations on making it this far. It's been a real rollercoaster. We're almost done....almost....

-   Open your Installation folder for Phoenix Flavour and launch ModOrganizer.exe.

-   Make sure the dropdown says SKSE and click Run.

-   Start a New Game. You'll start in the Live Another Life prison cell. Create your character, then wait for all of the mods to finish configuring.

-   When the text prompts stop appearing in the upper left corner, it's time for everyone's favorite part: MCM configuration!

Luckily, Phoenix has already set up a page full of recommended settings. Click the link below:

[Recommended MCM Settings for The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com/guide/new-game/)

I have also included my personal preference in regards to the A Matter of Time configuration. Simply open the MCM menu for A Matter of Time, select Preset, then Load User Settings. Close the MCM menu, and you'll see it magically move into the position I've set up for myself. Technology is crazy, man.
