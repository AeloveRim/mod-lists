DISCLAIMER:  \
**Qolore722 currently does not offer any support for automated setup installations; please **do not **ask him or his team about any issues you experience with Wabbajack. He recommends users at least read through[ the official guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) to get a basic understanding of the modding process. 

**DISCLAIMER #2:**

**This version of Viva New Vegas is different from the original.** If you want a version that is exactly the same as the original guide, please go to [the official guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) website and complete the guide manually. Once more,** Do Not** go to the original guide author about any issues with the wabbajack version. This version is not officially supported by the original guide author.

Please visit the[ Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack)channel if you need assistance!


<h2>Getting Started</h2>


<h3>Preface</h3>


The Wabbajack autoInstaller will **not** give you a working game out of the box, so you will **need to follow <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> steps** in this guide. This simple process should take roughly 30 min.-2 hours, depending on your computer/internet speed and modding knowledge. By contrast, following the[ the Viva New Vegas official guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) without Wabbajack typically takes ~8 hours! This guide has been made for moderately experienced users in mind; you are still expected to have basic knowledge of Fallout New Vegas modding and [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) (which is specifically designed to work with Bethesda games).

**Highly recommended:** If you wish to learn about MO2, watch these (extremely well-made!) official guide videos by [GamerPoets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruq6hQIAvB8&list=PLlN8weLk86Xh3ue76x2ibqtmMramwQmHB):

<h5>
    Important note: </h5>



    If your copy of Fallout New Vegas is installed in a default Windows system file branch
    (such as: C:\Program Files ; C:\Program Files (x86) ; Downloads ; Desktop), 
    reinstall it in a new location. 
    Installing in those areas can cause issues major down the line.

 

---




*   Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
*   Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: <code>D:\Wabbajack</code></strong>). 
    *   <strong>Make sure </strong>this is <strong>separate </strong>from your <em>Viva New Vegas</em> install folder, <strong>not </strong>in common folders like <em>Downloads </em>or <em>Desktop</em>. 
    *   <strong>Important note:</strong> 

        Installing any Bethesda-related modding software or setups in default Windows system files (such as: <em>C:\Program Files ; C:\Program Files (x86) ; Downloads, Desktop</em>) can cause <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">MAJOR </span></strong>problems down the line.)

*   Place **<code>Wabbajack.exe</code></strong> into this new <em>Wabbajack </em>folder.
*   Download the latest version of <code>Viva New Vegas Wabbajack</code> file
*   Create a folder named <em>Viva New Vegas </em>(or something similar). Do not place this folder inside the wabbajack folder! 
    *   Inside that folder, create another folder named <em>Downloads</em>.
    *   There should be <strong>nothing inside </strong>your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder other than this <em>Downloads</em> folder.
*   Manually download: 
*   1. <code>[Vanilla HUD Remastered Patch 1.83h](https://www.moddb.com/addons/start/171596?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fvivanewvegas.github.io%2Fhuduivui%2B.html)</code>
*   2. <code>[Spice of Life](http://download2134.mediafire.com/vfp4hfknt66g/ln1a2l2th1if8es/Spice+of+Life+Vanilla+v1-5+Release+Candidate.7z)</code>
*   Place these files inside your <em>Downloads</em> folder (within your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder). <strong>Do Not</strong> Extract the mods.
*   Launch <strong><code>Wabbajack.exe</code></strong>
*   Select ‚ÄúInstall from Disk‚Äù
*   Choose the Viva New Vegas <code>.wabbajack</code> file you just downloaded.
*   In ‚ÄúInstallation Location‚Äù, choose the <em>Viva New Vegas</em> folder. The ‚ÄúDownload Location‚Äù should update automatically. 
    *   Make sure it is pointing correctly to the <em>Downloads </em>folder you just created
*   Click the large ‚Äú<em>play</em>‚Äù button.
    *   If you get any sort of error, post your Wabbajack log in the #viva-new-vegas-support channel of the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack). (You can find this log in the same folder as <strong><code>Wabbajack.exe</code></strong> with the file name <strong><code>Wabbajack.exe.log</code></strong>.)
*   If you get a Nexus API request, accept it.
*   <strong>Wait.</strong> (This process is the longest of the setup, may take from 15 min- up to several hours, depending upon your hardware and internet connection speed.)
*   <strong>Do not close Wabbajack</strong> until the bottom left pane says ‚Äú<strong>Installation is complete. You may exit the program.‚Äù</strong>  \

*   Once installation is complete, open your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder. You should see another folder inside of it called <em>Game Folder Files</em>.
    *   Copy <strong>all </strong>files inside this folder into your <em>Fallout New Vegas </em>game directory  \
(the same folder where <code>FalloutNV.exe</code> is located).

<h3>Just a <em>few </em>more steps...</h3>


(Wabbajack cannot complete these by itself at this time.)



*   Open your _Viva New Vegas_ Folder 
    *   Open the _Tools_ folder within. 
    *   You should see an **_FNV BSA Decompressor_ **folder.
    *   Open this folder, right click on ‚Äú**<code>FNV BSA Decompressor.exe</code></strong>‚Äù, then click ‚ÄùRun as administrator‚Äù. 
        *   Read & follow the directions of the installer carefully. 
        *   Once it is finished, you can exit the program.
*   Right click on <strong><code>FalloutNVpatch.exe</code></strong> inside your <em>Fallout New Vegas</em> game folder. 
    *   Click ‚ÄùRun as administrator‚Äù. 
    *   Once the prompt appears, hit ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù. 
    *   Check that you now have 2 files: 
        *   (1) a <strong><em>new</em> </strong>[üìÅ](https://emojipedia.org/file-folder/)<strong> <code>FalloutNV.exe</code></strong> 
        *   (2) a <strong><em>separate</em> </strong>[üìÅ](https://emojipedia.org/file-folder/)<strong> <code>FalloutNV_backup.exe</code></strong>. 

    From now on, you will be starting the game with <strong><code>FalloutNV.exe</code></strong> from <em>Mod Organizer 2</em> (which Wabbajack automatically installed inside your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder).

 You **cannot** use an ENB with New Vegas Reloaded, as it can cause significant issues.  \
**If you wish to use an ENB**, untick this mod in MO2's left pane.




---




*   **Before** you start the game, you will need a program to cap your framerate. If you wish to play with over 60 frames you will need to set your desired max/min framerate in **New Vegas Tick Fix**. Double click on New Vegas Tick Fix in Mod Organizer 2. Click on the Ini Files tab. .You will need to set `iMaxFPS` to 160(or higher depending on your average fps ingame).
*   **Options:** If NVTF does not work for you with the above settings. Cap your framerate with one of the options below or another program of your preference.
    *   **Nvidia GPU** ‚á® you could use [Nvidia Profile Inspector ](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Dny2QYUB5wLrHPStwg4_WzpHCUs5xN15)
        *   (Find Fallout New Vegas in the dropdown list beside Profiles. Let the program load it‚Äôs settings. Scroll down and select the dropdown beside Frame Rate Limiter. You should select 60 FPS (or your Mas FPS from NVTF)then click on Apply Settings on the top right. These settings will save until you update your GPU drivers.)
    *   **AMD GPU** ‚á® you could use [RiviaTuner](https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download,16.html). Nvidia users may also use this program. (Instructions can be found in the main [guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/prerequisites.html))
    *   **Intel GPU**‚á® you could use various options (the best of which is TBA, a WIP)


    Now open up your MO2 **Fallout ini**, find the line that starts with **<code>SArchiveList</code>** and replace the entire line with the one below. If you do not do this you will have missing assets in your game! Make sure you save the ini after applying the changes.


```
        SArchiveList=Fallout - Invalidation.bsa, Fallout - Textures.bsa, Fallout - Textures2.bsa, Fallout 
        - Meshes.bsa, Fallout - Meshes2.bsa, Fallout - Voices1.bsa, Fallout - Sound.bsa, Fallout - Misc.bsa
```


Note: If you have a GOG copy of the game, there may be a FalloutNV_lang.esp in the right pane. If so, navigate to the Data folder and delete it

You are now ready to play _Viva New Vegas! Use the top right drop down list, select New Vegas, and click Run to start the game._  \
Enjoy!

<h2>Post-Install Notes/Troubleshooting</h2>




*   If you do not see any mods when opening Mod Organizer 2, make sure MO2 is in Portable Mode. You can put it in Portable Mode by clicking the ‚ÄúChange Game‚Äù button in the top-left,then selecting ‚ÄúPortable Mode‚Äù when MO2 restarts. 
*   **Important: In MO2, you will see mods with large red **[**X**]**‚Äô**s** on them saying **‚Äú**No valid game data**‚Äù**. This is normal. **(The mods were merged in order to reduce plugin count.)  \
**Do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT</span> touch them **unless you know what you are doing, otherwise **the modlist WILL break!**
*   Mod Configuration Menu settings can currently be found on the main guide. However, you are free to use whatever settings you prefer for gameplay. 
    *   **Note: Be careful **with the settings for **_JSawyer Ultimate Edition_**, as some of them are already covered by _Just Mods Assorted_ (both settings of which are nestled in-game, within MCM) and/or **_Stewie‚Äôs Tweaks <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(which is an <code>.ini </code>file, found outside the game)</span></em></strong>
    *   You <strong>are </strong>safe to: 
        *   Enable the <em>JSawyer EXP </em>preset
        *   change levels per perk
        *   change max level
*   Note if using an ENB with this list, you will have invisible armors. To fix it: Change FixTransparencyBugs=true to FixTransparencyBugs=false in the enblocal.ini
*   In your FalloutCustom INI, Change <strong><code>INumHWThreads</code> </strong>to the number of threads your CPU has. If you do not know how many threads your CPU has, use CPU-Z to find out. This may help with performance.
*   <strong><code>fXenonVertLookSpeed</code></strong> and <strong><code>fXenonHorizLookSpeed</code></strong> can be removed if you do not run the game in a <strong>16:9 </strong>aspect ratio. <strong> </strong>
