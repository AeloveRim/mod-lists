**DISCLAIMER:**  
**Qolore722 currently does not offer any support for automated setup installations**; please **do not** ask him or his team about any issues you experience with Wabbajack. He recommends users at least read through[ the official guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) to get a basic understanding of the modding process. 

**DISCLAIMER #2:**

**This version of Viva New Vegas is different from the original.** If you want a version that is exactly the same as the original guide, please go to [the official guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) website and complete the guide manually. Once more,** Do Not** go to the original guide author about any issues with the wabbajack version. This version is not officially supported by the original guide author.

Please visit the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) channel if you need assistance!


<h2>Getting Started</h2>


<h3>Preface</h3>


The Wabbajack autoInstaller will **not** give you a working game out of the box, so you will **need to follow <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> steps** in this guide. This simple process should take between 30 minutes and 2 hours, depending on your computer/internet speed and modding knowledge. By contrast, following the[ the Viva New Vegas official guide](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) without Wabbajack typically takes ~8 hours! This guide has been made for moderately experienced users in mind; you are still expected to have basic knowledge of Fallout New Vegas modding and [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) (which is specifically designed to work with Bethesda games).

**Highly recommended:** If you wish to learn about MO2, watch these (extremely well-made!) official guide videos by [GamerPoets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruq6hQIAvB8&list=PLlN8weLk86Xh3ue76x2ibqtmMramwQmHB).

You **cannot** use a previously modded Fallout New Vegas game  
(or else things will *probably* go wrong).
           
*   At least >**20GB of free space **on your drive.  
*   A **[Nexus Premium](https://www.nexusmods.com/register/premium)** account is needed for Wabbajack‚Äôs automatic downloading.
*   [Microsoft VC++ 2013](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/5/6/056dcda9-d667-4e27-8001-8a0c6971d6b1/vcredist_x86.exe)
    *   Run the installer and follow the instructions. (If you get a message that the program is already installed, exit.
*   [Microsoft VC++ 2015,2017.2019](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).  
    *   Click the <code>x64:vc_redist.x64.exe</code></strong> links under the ‚ÄúVisual Studio 2015, 2017, and 2019‚Äù header. 
    *   Run <em>both <code>.exe</code></em> files, follow the instructions.

<h5>
    Important note: </h5>



    If your copy of Fallout New Vegas is installed in a default Windows system file branch
    (such as: C:\Program Files ; C:\Program Files (x86) ; Downloads ; Desktop), 
    reinstall it in a new location. 
    Installing in those areas can cause issues major down the line.

*   Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
*   Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: <code>D:\Wabbajack</code>). 
    *   <strong>Make sure </strong>this is <strong>separate </strong>from your <em>Viva New Vegas</em> install folder, <strong>not </strong>in common folders like <em>Downloads </em>or <em>Desktop</em>. 
*   Place <code>Wabbajack.exe</code> into this new <em>Wabbajack </em>folder.  
*   Create a folder named <em>Viva New Vegas </em>(or something similar). Do not place this folder inside the Wabbajack folder!  
*   Create a folder inside your <em>Viva New Vegas </em> folder and name it <code>downloads</code>  
*   Manually download:  
*   1. <code>[Vanilla HUD Remastered Patch 1.83h](https://www.moddb.com/addons/start/171596?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fvivanewvegas.github.io%2Fhuduivui%2B.html)</code>  
*   2. <code>[Spice of Life](http://download2134.mediafire.com/vfp4hfknt66g/ln1a2l2th1if8es/Spice+of+Life+Vanilla+v1-5+Release+Candidate.7z)</code>  
*   Place these files inside your <em>downloads</em> folder (within your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder). <strong>Do Not</strong> Extract the mods.  
*   Launch <strong><code>Wabbajack.exe</code></strong>  
*   Select ‚ÄúBrowse Modlists‚Äù  
*   Download the latest version of <code>Viva New Vegas Wabbajack</code> file.  
*   In ‚ÄúInstallation Location‚Äù, choose the <em>Viva New Vegas</em> folder. The ‚ÄúDownload Location‚Äù should update automatically. 
    *   Make sure it is pointing correctly to the <code>downloads </code>folder you just created.  
*   Click the large ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button.
    *   If you get any sort of error, post your Wabbajack log in the #viva-new-vegas-support channel of the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack). (You can find this log in the same folder as <strong><code>Wabbajack.exe</code></strong> with the file name <strong><code>Wabbajack.current.log</code></strong>.)
*   If you get a Nexus API request, accept it.
*   <strong>Wait.</strong> (This process is the longest of the setup, may take from 15 min- up to several hours, depending upon your hardware and internet connection speed.)
*   Do not close Wabbajack until the bottom left pane says ‚Äú<strong>Installation is complete. You may exit the program.‚Äù</strong>  

*   Once installation is complete, open your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder. You should see another folder inside of it called <em>Game Folder Files</em>.
    *   Copy <strong>all </strong>files inside this folder into your <em>Fallout New Vegas </em>game directory  
(the same folder where <code>FalloutNV.exe</code> is located).

<h3>Just a <em>few </em>more steps...</h3>


(Wabbajack cannot complete these by itself at this time.)



*   Open your _Viva New Vegas_ Folder 
    *   Open the _Tools_ folder within. 
    *   You should see an **_FNV BSA Decompressor_** folder.
    *   Open this folder, right click on ‚Äú<code>FNV BSA Decompressor.exe</code>‚Äù, then click ‚ÄùRun as administrator‚Äù. 
        *   Read & follow the directions of the installer carefully. 
        *   Once it is finished, you can exit the program.
*   Right click on <strong><code>FalloutNVpatch.exe</code></strong> inside your <em>Fallout New Vegas</em> game folder. 
    *   Click ‚ÄùRun as administrator‚Äù. 
    *   Once the prompt appears, hit ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù. 
    *   Check that you now have 2 files: 
        *   (1) a <strong><em>new</em> </strong>[üìÅ]<strong> <code>FalloutNV.exe</code></strong> 
        *   (2) a <strong><em>separate</em> </strong>[üìÅ]<strong> <code>FalloutNV_backup.exe</code></strong>. 

    From now on, you will be starting the game with <strong><code>FalloutNV.exe</code></strong> from <em>Mod Organizer 2</em> (which Wabbajack automatically installed inside your <em>Viva New Vegas </em>folder).


<h4>
FPSFix from New Vegas Tick Fix is an extremely important setting. Sadly this cannot be automated as everyone‚Äôs computer specifications are different. Once you set this up you will have minimal to no stutter in your game. 
In the left pane in mo2 Double click on NVTF- New Vegas Tick Fix. Once it opens select the INI Files Tab.
Click in NVSE\Plugins\NVTF.ini under Ini Files. Scroll down to iMaxFPSTolerance.
This number should be set to 240. If you still have stuttering or sound issues replace this number with 300. 
*IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure bUseD3D9Ex is set to 0*

</h4>


Note: If you have a GOG copy of the game, there may be a FalloutNV_lang.esp in the right pane. If so, navigate to the Data folder and delete it.  

You are now ready to play *Viva New Vegas!* Use the top right drop down list, select New Vegas, and click Run to start the game. Unfortunately, the launcher may once again appear, configure your settings as you did before. If you are prompted about a read-only INI, have MO2 remove that flag. 
Enjoy!

<h2>Post-Install Notes/Troubleshooting</h2>


*   If updating your install, make sure all modding applications are closed. Download the new wabbajack file. You will install the modlist as you did before but this time you will be prompted to overwrite your previous install. Click yes and the install will continue.
*   **Important**: In MO2, you will see mods with large red **[**X**]**‚Äô**s** on them saying **‚Äú**No valid game data**‚Äù**. This is normal. (The mods were merged in order to reduce plugin count.)  
**Do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT</span> touch them **unless you know what you are doing, otherwise **the modlist WILL break!**
*   Mod Configuration Menu settings can currently be found on the main guide. However, you are free to use whatever settings you prefer for gameplay. 
    *   **Note**: Be careful with the settings for **_JSawyer Ultimate Edition_**, as some of them are already covered by _Just Mods Assorted_ (both settings of which are nestled in-game, within MCM) and/or *Stewie‚Äôs Tweaks* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(which is an <code>.ini </code>file, found outside the game)</span>
    *   You <strong>are </strong>safe to: 
        *   Enable the <em>JSawyer EXP </em>preset
        *   change levels per perk
        *   change max level
*   In your FalloutCustom INI, Change <strong><code>INumHWThreads</code> </strong>to the number of threads your CPU has. If you do not know how many threads your CPU has, use CPU-Z to find out. This may help with performance.
*   <strong><code>fXenonVertLookSpeed</code></strong> and <strong><code>fXenonHorizLookSpeed</code></strong> can be removed if you do not run the game in a <strong>16:9 </strong>aspect ratio. <strong> </strong>
